    <h1>VALORANT</h1>
    <p>
        Valorant is a 2020 first-person tactical hero shooter video game developed <br> and published by Riot Games.[3] A free-to-play game, Valorant <br>
        takes inspiration from the Counter-Strike series, borrowing several<br>
         mechanics such as the buy menu, spray patterns, and inaccuracy while <br>
        moving. Development started in 2014 and was teased under the codename Project A in 2019;<br>
         the game was released on June 2, 2020 for 
        Windows. It was ported to the PlayStation 5<br>
         and Xbox Series X/S in June 2024, albeit without crossplay between PC and console clients.
